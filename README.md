# ADM-HW1
This is the GitHub repository of Iliyas Kyrykbayev for the ADM course's homework #1

## Notes
1. I didn't realize I was using PyPy2 as a language until the string exercises. Luckily it didn't really matter.
2. We already used HackerRanks in our bachelor program, but solved only the SQL and Java problems, so no cheating for Python. You can see at the last page some previous submissions.
