# ADM-HW1
This is the GitHub repository of Iliyas Kyrykbayev for the ADM course's homework #1.

# Content
1. *scipts.ipynb* includes all the coding including both Problem 1 and Problem 2 (at the very end).
2. In *Submissions.pdf* you can find all the submission I did for the homework tasks.

## Notes
1. I didn't realize I was using PyPy2 as a language until the string exercises. Luckily it didn't really matter, just required some work with rewriting raw_input() as input().
2. We already used HackerRanks in our bachelor program, but solved only the SQL and Java problems, so no cheating for Python. You can see at the last page some previous submissions.
